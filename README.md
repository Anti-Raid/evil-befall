# Evil Befall

Evil Befall is a Go CLI for Anti-Raid demonstrating both usage of the API as well as being fully featured and potentially more feature complete than the website.

Because it is a CLI, there is less of a need to worry about design. Hence, Evil Befall can technically support features more quickly than the website can allowing for easier testing and development.
